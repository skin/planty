# planty

As you might know, we breathe, per year, oxygen that is extracted from 7/8 trees.
Unfortunately we are all always too busy to care about these facts.

But there's something we could easily do, give a plant as a gift to someone, maybe for a its birthday or for any special occasions.
It doesn't require so much time and it lets you take a small meaningful step towards the social cause.

When you plant trees, you are directly cleaning the air. A three can releases enough oxygen to supply an human being needs for two years.
This awesome gesture of gifting, let you grow your own virtual forest, collect points and redeem them as voucher for other purchases.
