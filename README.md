# planty

As you might know, we breathe, per year, oxygen that is equivalent to the one that is extracted from 7/8 trees.
Unfortunately we are all always too busy to care about these facts.

But there's something we could easily do, use Planty App and gift a plant to someone, maybe on a birthday or for any other special occasions. It's very handy way  and it lets you take a small meaningful step towards the social cause.
'Planty' is derived from 'Plenty of Plants'.

Bringing oxygen producing plants into your home or office is a way to mimic the healthy lifestyle. Planty let you do exactly the same thing. You buy and gift it for loved ones to make them feel special in a very unqiue way. You indirectly involve them in the good cause. You make them feel responsible towards that special plant and in a way towards enviornment.
Planty not only let you buy the plants, but let you grow your very own virtual forest. How awesome is that? :-) So in a way you are gifting the trees to your friends, mates, family yet everytime you are adding one tree into your forest.
Additionally, every plant gifting let you collect points which you redeem in your future purchases.

P.S. : At this moment the app can be viewed properly on iOS and Android MOBILE/SMARTPHONE devices.
